# Zomato FP&A Project (Manmeet Singh)

## Objective
Build a complete FP&A workflow using real financial statements of Zomato, reconstructing 36 months of monthly actuals and 24 months of forecast. 
This project demonstrates budgeting, forecasting, KPI analysis, and dashboarding.

## Includes:
- 36 months Actuals (FY22–FY24)
- 24 months Forecast (FY25–FY26)
- KPIs (Contribution, CM%, EBITDA Margin)
- Assumptions sheet (seasonality, cost ratios)
- Management-ready visual dashboards
- Variance analysis
- FP&A storytelling

📊 FP&A Insights Summary (Dec 2023)
1. Revenue momentum remained strong through FY24, though December saw a ~9% month-on-month dip driven by lower order volumes rather than cost pressure.
2. Contribution margin held steady at ~62% as delivery and marketing ratios stayed unchanged, indicating stable unit economics.
3. The Rolling 3-Month Revenue trend (~₹1,252 Cr) shows the dip was episodic, not structural, and underlying demand remains positive entering Q4 FY24.

## Tools Used
Excel, Power BI, GitHub

## Why Zomato?
Because it is a high-growth Indian consumer-tech company with detailed public disclosures, allowing realistic FP&A reconstruction.
